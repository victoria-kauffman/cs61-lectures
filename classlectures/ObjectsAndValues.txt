Type: Defines a set of related values in a programming language

Primitive Type: Irreducible (its values aren't composed of smaller values)
   - Different programming languages have different primitive types 
   - In C++, primitive types include integers, floating point numbers, and pointers
      - An address is a "pointer type"... address is a numeric value of the pointer type

Object: Value stored in memory
   - Standard: "a region of data storage in the execution envionrment, the contents of which can represent values"
   - Objects, unlike values, can change 
      - When you create variable "x", x is an Object
      - X is located in the memory

Computer software in execution deals with zeroes and ones (bits)
Byte: A group of 8 bits
  - A byte is a kind of integer between 0 and 255
     - You can only go up to 255 because 2^8 = 256 (number of possible patterns in binary)
  - 0b00000000 is the byte 0
     - You start with 0 so that nothing interprets it as a variable, but the b says it's in binary
  - 0b00000001 is the byte 1

Bytes are stored in memory
  - Memory is made up of billions and billions of transistorsâ€”MOSFETs: Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors
  - One we have the memory, we refer to the specific bytes by refering to it / changing it
  - Each byte of memory has an address, which is stored as another integer

Get the address of an object with "&"
  - Example: address of x is "&x"

If you change the value stored in a variable, you don't change the address

Programmer has complete control over memory

1000 in hexadecimal is e8 03 00 00
  - 1000 % 16 = 8
  - 1000 / 16 = 62
  - 62 % 16 = 14 = 0xe
  - 62 / 16 = 3

An integer is 4 bytes... you can store any number < 2^31 - 1

Integers are stored in contiguous bytes 
  - Efficiency --> faster to read addresses in memory when they are closer together

Testing sorting:
  - Test input and output have same length
  - Check if in ascending order
  - Check sum

Insertion sort: n^2 complexity

Performance mystery to ponder: it takes the insertion sort less time when using an array than when using a linked list
